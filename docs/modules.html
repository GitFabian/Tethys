<h1>Modules</h1>

<h3>Naming</h3>
A module has two names: A cleartext <code>title</code> and a unique <code>stringId</code>.
The namespace for the <b>stringId</b> is very restricted. The name occures in:
* PHP variable names
* DB table names
* Windows/Unix folder names
Additionnaly it will be pre- and suffixed (by underscore) in several contexts.
The remaining available characters are:
<p class="code">[A-Za-z0-9]</p>
<b class="note">The lowercase stringId of the module has to be unique (at least in each project)</b>

Uniqueness means you can't have two modules of the same <code>stringId</code> in the same project. Modules that are used in other
projects should register here to ensure their ID does not collide.
