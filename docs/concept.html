<h1>The concept</h1>

<h3>What is Tethys?</h3>
Tethys is a framework for developing (or just setting up) different kinds of web applications - hosted locally or in the
WWW. It holds all basic features such as authentification (part of user management), database access and a set of skins.
It also contains a broad range of features and tools that are used (and re-implmented) in almost every web application
(e.g. Navigation menue, forms, tables, AJAXing, dialogues, (CSV-)export, toolboxes for formatting and conversion (e.g.
strings and dates), email-support, logs and cronjobs (e.g. backup)). Assuming continuous development is part of your
project it's also important to have errorhandling- and development-tools.

<h3>Leightweight</h3>
Tethys is and always will be leightweight.
Only the pure bare basic core features are included in the repository <code>tethys</code>.
	Further functionalities are available as modules.
Third party libraries are used but not included in the repository. They have to be installed seperatly.
	Therefor they are referenced by a specific version number.

<h3>Less writing for everyday tasks</h3>
Tethys has its own syntax. Through objects and code completion modern IDE's will show you available commands.

<h3>Modularized</h3>
Every needs that exeed the core functionality are organized in <a href="modules.html">modules</a>. By picking and configuring the mudules you need
	you can ensure you have no extra load in your project. As your requirements changes, modules can be added and
	removed on the fly.
